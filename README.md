<h1>PathFinding Visualizer</h1>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run the project download the project and run :

<i>npm install</i>

<i>npm start</i>

This project was built as a web app to provide the visual representation of the famous pathfinding algorithms. 

The site is available at the following link live:

**Brief Highlights of the project:**
<ul>
<li>Implementation of Four different path finding algorithms. </li>

<li>Ability to move start and end nodes, add walls.</li>

<li>Ability to change the speed of visualization.</li>

Algorithms included are:

<li> Dijkstra's Algorithm: Searches the path by visiting the neighboring nodes. Guarantees shortest path</li>

<li> A star Search: Searches the path using a heuristic function that provides an estimate for the shortest path. The heuristic implemented is the Manhattan distance. Guarantees shortest path</li>

<li> Breadth First Search: Searches the path in a breadth first fashion. Think breadth wise (wider first) rather than deeper. Guarantees shortest path</li>

<li> Depth First Search: Searches the path in a depth first fashion. Think depth wise (deeper first) rather than wider. Does not guarantee shortest path</li>
